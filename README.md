You can add ur # here: https://www.twilio.com/console/phone-numbers/verified after signing in. Login credentials are classNotifierService@gmail.com and password is kangarookangaroo. The ex.jpg is supposed to show that it will text each user registered for a class. In this case, I just registered myself like 5 times. The ex2.jpg is for one user being registered for multiple classes. The ex3.jpg shows that the script can handle multiple users and classes simultaneously. I got these texts at the same time, being registered myself as well.
